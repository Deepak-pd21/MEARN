paragraph = "JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, and dynamically typed programming language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on web pages. Alongside HTML for structure and CSS for styling, JavaScript forms the third core technology of the World Wide Web, allowing for features like animated graphics, form validation, and real-time content updates that would be impossible with static HTML and CSS alone. Its capabilities extend beyond client-side web development to include server-side programming with Node.js, mobile app development, and even desktop applications, making it a powerful and widely adopted language in modern software engineering."
